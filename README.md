# CLA-vs-CRA
Compare Carry ripple adder and Carry-lookahead adder
We are using 32bits numbers but you can scale it to whatever is your need!
The top module consists of the two adders and a flag for verifying they got the same results.
Also we include a test.sv that uses 1000 numbers to simulate.
All the code is in systemverilog :)
